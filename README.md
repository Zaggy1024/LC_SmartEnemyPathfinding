# SmartEnemyPathfinding

A mod to allow the masked to use elevators in custom moons and interiors using PathfindingLib's smart pathfinding API. It will allow masked to find paths through elevators while they roam, as well as when they are attempting to exit the interior and start roaming outside.

Optionally, it can also allow the masked to roam in and out of both the main entrance and the fire exits, so that they can more naturally attempt to find players when none are inside, rather than bee-lining it straight to the main exit.
